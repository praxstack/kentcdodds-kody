# Onboarding

Three-step wizard after signup: connect an agent, make something useful (one
prompt plus first search), then connect a second agent from a different
ecosystem. Step 3 advertises Standard free for 2 weeks on that second unique
inbound client, pastes a portability-guide prompt, and, when the payload has a
known memory subject or package name, shows a short "You made …" chip.

## How to get there

Signed-in visit to `/onboarding` (resumes at the first unfinished step; finished
accounts land on Step 3 so connected agents stay visible). Step 1 is
`/onboarding/step-1` (optional `:agent`). Step 2 is `/onboarding/step-2`. Step 3
is `/onboarding/step-3` (optional `:agent`). Leftover
`/onboarding/step-2/:service` URLs redirect to Step 2. Also linked from account.

## Drive it

```bash
node tools/control-kody.ts preview -- \
  --request 'GET /onboarding.json' \
  --check /onboarding/step-1 \
  --check /onboarding/step-2 \
  --check /onboarding/step-3 \
  --request 'POST /onboarding/checklist-dismiss.json {}' \
  --request 'GET /onboarding.json'
```

## APIs

- `GET /onboarding.json`
- `POST /onboarding/checklist-dismiss.json`

## Gotchas

- `/onboarding` screenshots come from the real origin after
  `control-kody doctor` and `dev:ensure`. `dev:ensure` waits for a starting
  leftover instead of killing it mid-reload. Do not dump one onboarding
  component to static HTML.
- Step 3 completion is unique inbound OAuth `clientId`s ≥ 2, not raw grant
  count. Account → Connected agents is the grouped inbound list (logos for known
  kinds, newest-first). That first cross also records the one-time 14-day
  Standard gift (`secondAgentStandardGift` on `/onboarding.json`).
- The Discord invite sits below the step wizard. First-use setup (search,
  memory, execute, package, job, integration, secret, Discord membership) is on
  Waiting.
