# Onboarding process

The signed-in `/onboarding` wizard, the derived setup checklist, and the
optional first-win email guide share one contract:

[`packages/worker/universal/onboarding-process.ts`](../../../packages/worker/universal/onboarding-process.ts)

| Surface                                  | Role                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wizard index `/onboarding`               | Redirects to the first unfinished step (Step 3 once Step 2 is done)       |
| Wizard Step 1 `/onboarding/step-1`       | Connect an MCP host                                                       |
| Wizard Step 2 `/onboarding/step-2`       | Make something useful (one prompt + first `search` + `onboarding:guide`)  |
| Wizard Step 3 `/onboarding/step-3`       | Connect a second agent (same-ecosystem hosts greyed; `portability:guide`) |
| Checklist                                | Verify email, complete the three wizard steps, then persist a package     |
| [`first-win`](../../guides/first-win.md) | Optional email → reply → memories loop after a host is connected          |

Step 2 is one copy-paste prompt that tells the connected agent to retrieve
[`onboarding`](../../guides/onboarding.md)
(`search({ entity: "onboarding:guide" })`). The page shows a spinner until Kody
observes that first successful `search` (or an existing access win: memory,
execute, or saved package). Leftover `/onboarding/step-2/:service` URLs redirect
to Step 2. Hosted / platform OAuth is not the onboarding path; new connects are
bring-your-own.

Step 3 reuses the Step 1 agent picker. Hosts in the same vendor family as the
first agent are greyed so the second connect is a different ecosystem. After the
person picks a host, a short portability-proof prompt is folded into the same
step so the new agent looks up [`portability`](../../guides/portability.md)
(`search({ entity: "portability:guide" })`) and reuses what Step 2 made. When
the onboarding payload has a known memory subject or saved-package name, Step 3
shows a short "You made …" chip (truncated subject and `@scope/kody-id`, or
hidden if nothing sensible). `hasSecondMcpClient` is unique inbound OAuth
`clientId`s ≥ 2, not raw grant count and not attribution to the selected host —
the connected label stays "You've connected a second agent." When the
second-agent Standard gift is active, that status adds "Standard is free for 2
weeks." Step 3 copy advertises "Connect a second agent and get Standard free for
2 weeks." Same-ecosystem greying stays picker UX only. `/onboarding` resumes at
that step instead of always opening the Step 1 picker, and every wizard step
still lists already-connected hosts so a return visit cannot hide Cursor or
Claude Desktop. Account → Connections (`/account/connections`) lists those
inbound hosts grouped by display name, with public logos for known kinds,
newest-first sort, best-effort labels, and per-`clientId` revoke. That list is
not `users.mcp_client_name` (first-touch) and not `/account/mcp-oauth-clients`
(user-minted confidential clients).

`first-win` is not a wizard step and is not a checklist item. Signed-in
`/onboarding` does not probe Mailbox for that loop. MCP registers
`onboarding_first_win` and `search({ entity: "first_win:guide" })` serves the
guide.

Waiting (`/account/waiting` and `waitingSummary`) is a separate current-state
queue. Wizard-resume and first-use cards live there. See
[Waiting](../../use/waiting.md).

## Alignment check

`packages/worker/universal/onboarding-process.node.test.ts` (part of
`npm run test:node` / `npm run validate`) requires `docs/guides/first-win.md` to
name each current wizard step (label or path). `docs/guides/quick-example.md`
names Step 2's label and the Step 1 path. The first-run briefing is
`docs/guides/onboarding.md`.

Change the wizard in `onboarding-process.ts` first, then update those two guides
until the test passes. The same check requires `docs/guides/portability.md` to
name Step 3 and stay short. The checklist union has no first-win items; adding
them fails the same check.
